# [Project 1: Does age matter in Powerlifting?](https://github.com/Rommanahad/Powerlifting_)
* Cleaned data from excel utilising pandas
* Used a Lasso Regression to produce a graph which indicates which feature is the most significant
* The graph displays the coefficient of age to be 0. This enables to conclude that age does not matter in Powerlifting! I'm too old is no longer an excuse...
